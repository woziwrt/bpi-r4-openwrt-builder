 Notes for those who want to create their own experimental releases:
- use only VERIFIED mainline openwrt commits
- not all mtk  commits on their git are fully functional and each other compatible
  with mainline openwrt commits and can require additional patching for successful 
  build
 
  
 Tested on VMware Fusion, Workstation and Hyper-V
